# Online Billing System

This online billing system was developed as a project to introduce us to the use of web tecnologies in the world wide web. It consists of an online platform that allows users to manage their inventories of products, their groups of clients and for the creation of invoices for products sold. For its development we used PHP and SQL for the backend, HTML/CSS and javascript/jquery for the frontend of the application and json for the data structures format. For the interaction with these data structures and with the database, we created an API responsible for the:

* Creation, search and list of summarized documents;
* Visualization of documents details;
* Formatting of documents to A4 impression;
* Creation and edition of Invoices;
* Creation and Edition of Products;
* Creation and Edition of Clients;
* Session Management (Register, login and logout);
* Change of user permissions by the Admin.
